					<h1>Angular</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The first version was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS">AngularJS</a>.</p>
					<p>Javascript framework was created by Google in 2009.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="fragments">					
					<h3>Next Angular version was</h3>
					<p class="fragment">Angular2</p>
					<p class="fragment">Angular4</p>
					<p class="fragment">Angular5</p>
					<p class="fragment">Angular6</p>
					<p class="fragment">Angular7</p>
					<p class="fragment">Angular8</p>

					<h3>Naming</h3>
					<p>
						Originally, the rewrite of AngularJS was called "Angular 2" by the team, but 
						this led to confusion among developers. To clarify, the team announced that 
						separate terms should be used for each framework with "AngularJS" referring 
						to the 1.X versions and "Angular" without the "JS" referring to versions 2 and up.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>Differences between Angular and AngularJS</h3>					
						<p>Angular was designed as a ground-up rewrite of AngularJS.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Angular does not have a concept of "scope" or controllers, 
							instead it uses a hierarchy of components as its primary architectural characteristic.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Angular has a different expression syntax, focusing on "[ ]" for property 
							binding, and "( )" for event binding
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Modularity – much core functionality has moved to modules
						</p>
					</section>
					<section id="fragments">
						<p>
							Angular recommends the use of Microsoft's TypeScript language, 
							which introduces the following features:
						</p>
						<p class="fragment">Static Typing, including Generics</p>
						<p class="fragment">	Annotations	</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							TypeScript is a superset of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), and is 
							backwards compatible with ECMAScript 5 (i.e.: JavaScript).
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Dynamic loading</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Asynchronous template compilations</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Iterative callbacks provided by RxJS. RxJS limits state 
							visibility and debugging, but these can be solved with 
							reactive add-ons like ngReact or ngrx.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Support for Angular Universal, which runs Angular applications on servers
						</p>
					</section>

					<h3>What is the meaning of SPA and its application</h3>
					<p>
						Single Page Application (SPA or single-page application) implements user-friendly, 
						interactive services. The simplest example is Gmail.						
					</p>
					<p>
						Are you interested in what resources Angular has implemented? On the Made with 
						Angular site you will find a <a href="https://www.madewithangular.com/categories/angular/">list</a> listing sites created using different versions of the framework.

					<h3>Main points of Angular architecture:</h3>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Module</h3>
					<p>
						-structural units of application that encapsulate a certain logic. 
						In Angular, these are structures that store certain components, 
						directives, and services that are combined with a certain logic. 
						An example would be a user profile, a module for writing a letter, 
						an overview of a list of letters, and more.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Component</h3>
					<p>
						-typescript class that stores data and logic for displaying 
						this data in a template. The template is closely related to 
						the component. Component data can be easily displayed in a 
						template using a special syntax. The component can also 
						"capture" data from the template and retrieve it directly 
						in the script.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Template</h3>
					<p>
						- HTML code snippet with custom syntax added. It allows you 
						to embed data from a component into the template without 
						using innerHTML and similar methods. The template is 
						specified in the component and is part of its configuration.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
					<h3>Service</h3>
					<p>
						—in Angular is a typescript class that performs tasks related 
						to retrieving, storing, and processing data. For example, 
						logging, converting data for later transfer to a component, 
						accessing the backend, and more. Unlike components and 
						directives, services do not work with views (templates) directly.
					</p>
				</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Tasks of services:</h4>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Provide application data. The service itself may store the 
							data in memory or, to retrieve the data, access a data 
							source, such as a server;
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							The service can encapsulate business logic, various 
							computing tasks, logging tasks that are better off 
							taking components out. This way, the component code 
							will be focused directly on the presentation. In addition, 
							we can solve the problem of code repetition if we 
							need to perform the same task in different components 
							and classes.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Router</h3>
					<p>— is a router that is designed to switch between screens to display 
						different content..
					</p>
					<p>
						In other words, when you change the URL snippet in the browser's 
						address bar, the router monitors these changes and downloads 
						one or the other part of the application.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Pipe</h3>
					<p>
						-a pipe takes in data as input and transforms it to a desired output.
					</p>
				</section>				
				<section>
					<h3>Directive</h3>
					<p>-allow direct access to the DOM of your elements</p>
				</section>

					<h3>Thanks</h3>
